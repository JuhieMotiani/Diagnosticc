# Diagnosticc
It is a Covid-19, Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray detection Web-App üñ• where you can detect the X-ray from the given 3 classes, Flask is used to amalgamate backend with the fronted.

## Explanation of the Project
- We've trained the Detection model using two algorithms that is CNN and VGG16. We have used CNN model in Web-app because CNN produced an testing accuracy of 95.17% beating VGG16 by 4%.

- The Dataset we've used to train our models is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hQ5ihPKGIdbe8qNwKIwtmlj1yytZiiNE?usp=sharing).

- You can find Colab file to train CNN from here [here](https://github.com/JuhieMotiani/Diagnosticc/blob/main/CNN_Model.ipynb).

- You can find Colab file to train VGG16 from here [here](https://github.com/JuhieMotiani/Diagnosticc/blob/main/VGG16_Model.ipynb).

- After training the model, we have created a Flask Web-Application that can easily diagnose the covid-19, pneumonia and normal from the uploaded chest X-ray image.

## Project Set-up Guidelines
1. Dowload or clone this repo and open it in any IDE like VSCode, PyCharm, etc.
2. Open the terminal, create a virtual environment. 
3. Install the required libraries that are neccesary from [requirements.txt](#).
4. Go to the app directory in virtual environment.
5. Run the code ``python app.py``
